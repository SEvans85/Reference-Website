		<div class="box grid2"><p>Orphea, Heir of Raven Court, is a Ranged Assassin Hero, and the first Hero to be wholly original to the Heroes of the Storm universe. Rejecting the dark power her father had begun to consort with, Orphea tried to run away from the Raven Lord's influence. But after witnessing King's Crest fall to his machinations, she was convinced she needed to stand and fight. She now vows to protect the innocent--as a Hero of the Nexus. She was announced at BlizzCon 2018 and available for free to attendees and Virtual Ticket holders.</p></div>

		<div class="box grid6"><p>Chen Stormstout was born and raised on the Wandering Isle, a massive landmass on the back of the giant turtle Shen-zin Su. There, he developed his superior fighting skills and the desire to explore and discover new lands (and new ingredients for his legendary brews) like the traveling Pandaren who left Pandaria thousands of years past. Chen's wanderlust led him into adventure after adventure, from the creation of the wildly popular Brewfest event to the very founding of Durotar, where he fought along with the re-formed Horde to establish it in its new home.</p></div>
